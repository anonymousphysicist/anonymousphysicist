## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- qiskit (Quantum computing library)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymousphysicist/EmbeddedTime.git
cd EmbeddedTime
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples on how to use the quantum algorithms developed in this project.

```python
# Example usage
from src.quantum_algorithm import run_quantum_algorithm

result = run_quantum_algorithm()
print(result)


### 3. **Update requirements.txt**

Ensure that `requirements.txt` includes all necessary dependencies for your algorithm:
